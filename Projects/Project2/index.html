    <p class = "page-paragraph"> The player can move, jump and rotate in the air to perform tricks, along with the ability to move along a stage the 
      player can also attack enemies and parry attacks. Performing tricks gives the player meter, allowing them to perform special actions.
       Moving across the stage, the player encounters platforms of various types such as moving, and 
      crumbling. The player will also come across objects such as a jump booster which allows the player to jump in the air when in the proximity 
      of the booster.
