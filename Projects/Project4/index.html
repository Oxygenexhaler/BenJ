            <p class = "page-paragraph"> Sea Skirmish was a school project. It is s 2 player pvp battle arena game. Each player controls a ship, of 
              which there are multiple to choose from. The arena is a small archipelago, here the player can destroy islands to get temporary powerups
              avoid hazards like a whirlpool or an erupting volcano, or simply try and outmaneuver and destroy the enemy ship. Damage is dealt through shooting 
              cannon-balls at or dash-ramming into the other player's ship. Bigger ships have more hp and deal more damage, but smaller ships are faster.
