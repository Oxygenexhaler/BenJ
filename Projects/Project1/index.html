    <h1 align="center">Dungeon Dive</h1>
    <p align="center">Dungeon Dive is a turn based combat dungeon crawl. The idea behind the game is based on the assumption that there are two 
      popular types of turn based combat games in the modern scene, party based systems (Baldurs gate, Dragon quest , Bards tale IV,
       Darkest Dungeon, among others), and deck builders (Slay the spire, Die in the dungeon, Across the Obelisk, amongst others). A lot of the 
       time when playing a single character turn based combat game, the combat is often a bit simplistic, or the combat is based in an arena
       where movement is a large part of the system. Dungeon Dive is an attempt at creating a single character turn based combat game, where
       movement is fixed during combat, but the inherent actions available to the player, combines with the actions of the enemies to create 
       a complex turn based dynamic.
